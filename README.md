# IS545FinalProject_NBA
This visualization page is for NBA 2022 playoff season. The dataset is from NBAStuffer.Since the data is updated in real time, I used the version as of 05/02/2022.

## Map of Teams and Barchart of Team Size
The first visualization is a map of the team locations. Each blue circle represents a team with the Team name displayed on the map. The size of the blue circle is adjusted according to the team size. However, the difference between team size is rather small. Therefore the difference in the circle size cannot be easily detected. I have created a barchart of team size side by side to facilitate viewing the map.

## Comparison between Versatility Index and Minutes Percentage
This is a side-by-side comparison of the player's versatility index and minutes percentage in a team. A dropdown menu for team selection is at the very bottom of the page. By viewing the graph on the left, we could see which player in the team has the best Versatility Index. This index represents the player's overall performance in points, assists, and rebounds. The graph on the right shows the percent of minutes used by a player. By combining the two graphs, we could see which players are the most important players in a team. The longer minute percentage, the more important he is to the team. Usually, a player with higher VI would also have more minutes in the game. Both graphs are also colored by the player's age, with the older players being dark blue and younger player being light blue. The color would also show us whether the core of the team is younger or older.

## Brush selection of 2Point% and 3Point%
The scatterplot shows the 2Point% and 3Point% of each player. The user can brush select which points they want to view, and the player's information such as their full name, 2Point%, 3Point%, and Team would be shown in the table on the right. The max length of the table is set to be 25 to prevent it being too long. Each data point is also colored according to the player's age, where older players have darker blue. Some players don't have the data of 2Point% and 3Point% because the playoff season is still continuing, and they don't have any 2Point or 3Point attempts as of 05/02/2022 when I accessed the dataset.
